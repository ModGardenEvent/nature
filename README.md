**BlanketCon '25** was an in-minecraft virtual event that ran from April 26th through 29th, 2025.

This modpack contains all mods from the event - and the convention server ip, packed with community-made booths!

**The convention server is still open!** - join on in and explore with your friends. 

**Key Features**:
- Check out 234 convention "booths" built to show off mods, modpacks, and other modding projects!
- Explore a vibrant island of castaways that mysteriously migrates across the ocean... 
- Traverse the map by train, car, skates, stopwatches, and much, much more!
- Find and earn 388 collectible "shards", tracking booth visits, hidden secrets, and tricky challenges!
- Put sunglasses on a pineapple! (huh?)
